This is the localhost version of the project CosmosOdyssey which uses PostgreSQL as its database.  
Setup:  

Configure "Postgre credentials.txt" to match your database port number, username and password.  
Line 2 (port=5432) change "5432" to match the database's port number.  
Line 4 (user=postgres) change "postgres" to match the database's user name.  
Line 5 (pass=1245) change "1245" to match the database's password.  
Configure "Localhost port.txt" to match the default port of the local server.  
Line 1 (port=8080) change "8080" to match the default port of the local server.  
Run the program using Intellij IDEA or similar IDE that will automatically build the Maven project.
